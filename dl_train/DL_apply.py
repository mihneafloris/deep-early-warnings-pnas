10 of the DL models are trained on training set data that are censored (padded) 
on the left hand side only, hence they are trained on data that always includes 
the transition.  The other 10 were trained on training set data that are 
censored on both left and right, hence they do not include the transition.
kk runs from 1 to 10 and denotes the index of the 10 models of each type.
model_type is 1 or 2.  1 denotes the model that is trained on data censored on 
both the left and right.  2 is the model trained on data censored on the left only.

'''  
The following two parameters control how many sample points along the 
timeseries are used, and the length between them.  For instance, for an input 
time series equal to or less then length 1500, mult_factor=10 and 
pad_samples=150 means that it will do the unveiling in steps of 10 datapoints, 
at 150 evenly spaced points across the entire time series (150 x 10 = 1500).
Needs to be adjusted according to whether you are using the trained 500 length 
or 1500 length classifier.
